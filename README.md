## Rollup basic config

**usage**

use `npm` or `yarn` to add dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` and change files in directory 'src'. When you are done, run `npm run build` and your code will be bundled into directory dist.

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
// development mode
npm run dev

// production mode
npm run build
```
